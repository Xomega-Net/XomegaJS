{"name":"Xomegajs","tagline":"JavaScript version of the powerful MVVM Xomega Framework","body":"# XomegaJS\r\n\r\nXomegaJS is a next generation MVVM framework for building powerful data oriented HTML5 single page applications (SPA).\r\nIt is developed with TypeScript to provide type safety and compilation, promote reusability and ensure consistency\r\nacross the application, which is especially valuable for large scale SPA projects.\r\n\r\nXomegaJS uses Knockout, JQuery and other popular JavaScript frameworks to deliver highest quality functionality\r\nand speed up application development.\r\n\r\n## XomegaJS Highlights\r\n\r\nXomegaJS provides Type Script implementation for most of the features found in the [Xomega Framework](http://xomfwk.codeplex.com) \r\nfor traditional desktop or ASP.NET development. Here are some major features of those.\r\n\r\n* **Data Properties** that support single or multiple values, state management, like editability or visibility, etc.\r\n* **Data Objects** and Lists for view models that consist of Data Properties and nested objects.\r\n* **Lookup cache** for static and dynamic Lists Of Values with self-indexing lookup tables.\r\n* **Two-way Binding** of the Data Properties to the HTML5 controls, including values, property state and lists of possible values.\r\n* **Custom formatting** of display and edit values.\r\n* **Validation** with standard and custom validators.\r\n* **Error reporting** framework.\r\n* **Modification tracking** to prompt for unsaved changes.\r\n* **REST Services communication** framework.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n1. The easiest way to get started with XomegaJS is to install our free Visual Studio extension Xomega.Net,\r\nwhich provides preconfigured project templates for SPA applications, and allows you to instantly generate\r\ncomplete and powerful HTML5 search and details views based on XomegaJS right from your service model.\r\nPlease check [our web site](http://xomega.net) for more details.\r\n\r\n2. A more manual way involves adding XomegaJS Nuget package to your Visual Studio project\r\nand read [How To guides on our forum](http://xomega.net/Tutorials/HowTos.aspx). Feel free to post your questions there if you don't find the information you need.\r\n\r\n3. And, of course, you can always download the code and build it manually. You're welcome to post any issues,\r\nfork the code and create pull requests with any fixes or enhancements.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
